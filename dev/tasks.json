The client is controlling the camera remotely by sending instructions to the server to update position of client. The Opengl Game Engine checks the server every game loop iteration and updates the camera's position. A server thread is created at the start of the application with its own main loop to listen for incoming connections. When a client connects another thread is created for the client's connections. The Server waits for the client's quit command to end connection.",
