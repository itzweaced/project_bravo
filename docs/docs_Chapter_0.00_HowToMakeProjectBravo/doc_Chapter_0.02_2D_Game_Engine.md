Create a Object Oriented Game Engine in Terminal

# Description
Create a 2D Game Engine in Console/Terminal using ASCII characters. A good starting goal is making a clone of the game Pong. It has 2x Players and can demostrate Rigid Bodies "Movement" and AABB Colliders for collisions. And if your ambitious enough try adding a Network Socket Server and Network Socket Client to it.
