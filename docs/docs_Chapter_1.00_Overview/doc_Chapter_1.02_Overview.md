# Overview
- Desrciption: Project Bravo is Light Weight Game Engine
- It's based on the Entity Component System (ECS)
- The game engine is broken into two parts, the "Game" and the "Engine"
- Engine is made up of modules
- Game can use modules from Engine to build a game
- The "Header File(s) .h" and "Src File(s) .cpp" are seperated into directory paths src and include
- The Engine is based on the Entity Componentn System
- Anything that can be spawned inside a 2D or 3D world is treated as a Entity.
- A Asset Config File contains a Asset's file paths and ID integer. The ID will be used so a Entity can be associated with it.
- A Entity File is used for Cameras, Models, and Geometry. It contains information such as Asset ID and a object Position, Rotation, and Scale.
- I like visualizing this project like a pyramid
    - Where App is at the Top, it the actual application for system, the actual EXE
    - Then there is Game the Middle, it the actual game area that uses engine to create to hearts content. You can afford to be a little sloppy.
    - Then there is Engine the Bottom, it's the foundation. Its made of components that can be used to build a game. This is where features are added. I see this as the level that talks to the machine/hardware.
